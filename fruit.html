        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
	<p>This page is mainly going to be focused on my journey with fruit, veganism, farming, permaculture, homesteading and <a href="https://www.fruitnut.net/destination-eden">fruitarianism.</a> Right now it's very basic becuase I'm making it from scratch with raw HTML, and CSS in between my studies and work. With them I'll be adding more Javascript to it and make it look more aesthetically pleasing.</p>

	<p>On Tuesday, the 8th of July, 2025, I left Florida for the second time. While I was traveling, I got to rest and take a break to visit my good friends Jeremey and Kim in Georgia. They were the first people I met in Philly years ago who were just as passionate about fruit as me. It has been awe-inspiring to see how much they achieved in a few short years. They bought 5 acres 3 years ago, and they already have 200 fruit trees planted! Literally that is the goal for me and all my close loved ones. When they first got the land, I was helping them pull the weeds out of the soil; it is beyond beautiful coming back and seeing the trees. Jeremy was showing me how they set up their irrigation system and compost tea to take care of the trees and even how they use barrels to help the trees survive in the winter cold. Kim said when she came she wanted to go to a farmers market, but they didn't have one. So she ended up making her own and literally filled up all the vendor spots to the point where it maxed out! She told me that the people in her community said they always wanted to make a farmers market, but it took Kim's passion and dedication to make it a success! I'm so proud of you both; thanks for being a constant light and motivation! Make sure to follow and support them.

	I've been focused on career, coding, certification, clearances, and college stuff recently, and you will see me online speaking about intricate cybersecurity acronyms and programming paradigms. I genuinely do love all of that, and soon all these keyboard presses will be translated into fruit trees being planted on our land. I've worked and lived on farms and permaculture eco-villages in Homestead, Florida, and Ecuador, and I've seen how much work it takes to obtain and sustain those, and I know what I'm focused on now will help make everything easier for my family. In terms of passion and purpose, I'll share the passion and purpose of farming, fruitarianism, homesteading, and permaculture with our children. I can already feel the soil under our feet. Also, check out my website that I'm building out to have my own safe space outside of these social media platforms.
