	<h1>Linux is love! Linux is life! </h1>
	<p>I've been using Linux for years, let this page be a passino of love, sharing more of what I'm currently leanring and getting into. I used Linux for personal use and now I'm focusing on devleoping more of my professional skills with it.Red Hat Entreprise Linux is usually what majority of corporate Linux servers run so I think it's smart to lean deeper into using RHEL and distros that are similar to it to so make my personal and professional computing workflow overlap. I tried to get RHEL on my computer via USB awhile ago but that process was overly complex and I kept facing issues while also trying to learn other things for work and my certification. I recently start using my personal computer again and decided to get WSL just as a easier way to dive into the RHEL syntax, package managment and mentality. Here are some of the commands that I had to use to install Alama Linux 10 Kiteen on WSL</p>

	<p>sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools" -y
sudo dnf install git cmake ncurses-devel libX11-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel libXext-devel -y
</p>

<p>I am going to build this out more, for right now more of my focus is going towards <a href="databricks_engineering.html" target="_blank"> Databricks Engineering </a>. Check it out!</p>
