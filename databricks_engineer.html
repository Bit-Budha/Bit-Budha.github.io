	<h1>DATABRICKS ENGINEER</h1>
	<p>Peace, I hope you are well, thanks for coming to my pag, I made this page to showcase all of the concepts, ideas, definitions, acronyms, visuals, technologies and programs that I'm learning as I get deeper into learning Databricks Engineering to help my company RELI GROUP INC and work towards becoming a Databricks Engineer with them. It's something that they need a lot of help with currently so I'm going to learn as much as I can go help them and help myself.</p>
